    <h1>About</h1>
    

    <p>I&#8217;m currently working primarily as a researcher with the <a href="http://mediangroup.org">Median
Group</a>. The name of this website, <em>Countless and
Absurd</em>, is a reference to Hecataeus, reflecting my belief that logography
is as necessary in post-modernity as it was in 6th century <span class="caps">BC</span> Ionian&nbsp;Greece. </p>
<p>I have few mostly unorganized and incomplete projects on my <a href="https://github.com/BaeoMaltinsky">Github</a>.

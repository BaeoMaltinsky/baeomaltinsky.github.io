<p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> was a
first century Roman author known mostly for his final work <em>Natural
History</em>, possibly the most popular encyclopedia in Europe for 1500
years. Among classicists, he is also regarded as one of the worst
stylists of the classical Latin canon<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In truth Pliny had neither literary skill nor sense of propriety, and
he failed to discipline his thoughts. The ornaments he parades differ
somewhat from those employed by his contemporaries, mainly because
they are more crude. He can be florid in the extreme, accumulating
vacuous phrases, and he turns out epigrams of exceptional extravagance
and insipidity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Popular science writing apparently hasn't changed very much.</p>
<p>Something that is sometimes overlooked is Pliny's social criticism. He
will, at the slightest hint of opportunity, use the discussion of some
specialist topic like metallurgy or botany to start complaining about
societal pathologies (real or perceived). Pliny saw the rise and
consequences of economic globalization and material abundance, a
republican government corrupted by monetary interests and increasingly
by centralized executive authority, an environment ravaged and exploited
to fuel consumerism, and a decline of interest in scholarship for the
sake of knowledge. It's important not to overstate the similarity
between Pliny's world and our own. In our time, slavery and infanticide
are no longer practiced in most of the world (at least not openly).
Still, when reading Pliny I'm often struck by how familiar his polemics
can be. With that said, not taking any of this too seriously, I've
collected and lightly edited a few of Pliny's more relatable passages.</p>
<h1 id="pliny-on-drone-warfare">Pliny on Drone Warfare</h1>
<p>To open with a light subject, Pliny discusses the nefarious use of
technology by the military-industrial complex<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iron is the best and worst of life’s materials. With iron we plough
the ground, plant trees, trim other trees that support our vines, and
compel the vines to put out new shoots by cutting out dead wood every
year. With it we build houses, quarry rocks and achieve many other
useful tasks. But we also use iron for wars and bloodshed and plunder.
We use it not only at close quarters, but as winged missiles. Once
iron projectiles were hurled by the arm, but now they are actually
equipped with wings! This I consider to be the most criminal misuse of
man’s genius: to make it possible for death to reach human beings more
quickly, we have taught iron how to fly and have given it wings!</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="pliny-on-click-bait">Pliny on Click-Bait</h1>
<p>Pliny explains how the attention economy (currently being exploited by
advertising companies) has its roots not in the smart phone, but in
papyrus<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Greeks have a wonderful flair for inventing titles for books. They
called one Honeycomb; others called their works Violets, Muses,
Encyclopedias, Manuals, Meadow, Plague, Impromptu–eye-catching titles
that might cause a man to jump bail. But when you dip inside what
emptiness awaits you!</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="pliny-on-alcoholic-beverages">Pliny on Alcoholic Beverages</h1>
<p>Pliny seems to regard alcohol as one of life's great evils<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Careful investigation reveals that no activity takes up more of a
man’s life than producing alcoholic beverages, as if Nature had not
given us a perfectly healthy liquid to drink–namely, water–of which
all other animals avail themselves! ... All this toil and effort is
the price paid for something that alters men’s minds and produces
madness. Because of the drink thousands of crimes have been committed,
and drinking occasions so much pleasure that a huge section of mankind
knows no other reward in life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's particularly disturbed by drinking competitions and drinking
games<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">5</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alcohol is drunk as a result of debauchery, and drunkenness is even
promoted by the offer of a prize and—heaven help us!–is actually
purchased. One man get a prize if he eats as much as he drinks.
Another drinks as many cups as a throw of the dice demands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As always, he speaks about social pathology with his characteristic
subtlety<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#6">6</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even in the most favourable circumstances the intoxicated never see
the sunrise and so shorten their lives. This is the reason for pale
faces, hanging jowls, sore eyes and trembling hands that spill the
contents of full vessels; this the reason for swift retribution
consisting of horrendous nightmares and for restless lust and pleasure
in excess. The morning after, the breath reeks of the bottle and
everything is forgotten–the memory is dead. This is what people call
‘enjoying life’; but while other men daily lose their yesterdays,
these people also lose their tomorrows.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="pliny-the-elder-on-pliny-the-elder">Pliny the Elder on Pliny the Elder</h2>
<p>The nice people at <a href="https://russianriverbrewing.com/pliny-the-elder/">Russian River
Brewery</a> have done
Pliny the honor of naming a beer after him<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#8">7</a></sup>. I assume it's an oversight
on their part that they don't have his thoughts on beer (and alcohol in
general) printed on every bottle<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#7">8</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Western people also have their own liquor made from grain soaked in
water. Alas, what wonderful ingenuity vice possesses! We have even
discovered how to make water intoxicating!</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="pliny-on-food-as-recreation">Pliny on Food as Recreation</h1>
<p>Pliny is concerned about food not being bland enough<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#9">9</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is amazing that pepper is so popular. Some substances attract by
their sweetness, others by their appearance, yet pepper has neither
fruit nor berries to commend it. Its only attraction is its bitter
flavour, and to think we travel to India for it! Who was the first man
willing to try this on his food, who, because of his greedy appetite,
was not content merely to be hungry?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has enough flavor without added spices.</p>
<h1 id="pliny-on-consumerism-and-the-environment">Pliny on Consumerism and the Environment</h1>
<p>Pliny takes issue with his society's desire for luxury, pointing to the
quarrying of mountains and drinks cooled by ice<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#10">10</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We quarry mountains and drag them off solely for our pleasure –
mountains that we once considered it a remarkable feat even to have
crossed. ... Now these same mountains are quarried for a thousand
types of marble. Promontories are opened up to the sea, Nature is
levelled. We carry off materials which were meant as barriers between
nations; ships are built to transport the marble. Thus mountain-ranges
are carried here and there over the waves, Nature’s wildest domain.
Nevertheless we have a better excuse for this than we have for
climbing to the clouds in search of vessels in which to keep drinks
cold and for hollowing out rocks that approach heaven so that we may
drink from ice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, with the globalized economy of the late first century one
could at least import high quality sand from Africa<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#11">11</a></sup> and iron and
textiles from China<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#12">12</a></sup>. Such wonders.</p>
<h2 id="pliny-on-blood-diamonds">Pliny on Blood Diamonds</h2>
<p>He doesn't seem to care for jewelry<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#13">13</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet so that what she suffers on her surface, her outermost skin, may
seem bearable by comparison, we penetrate her inmost parts, digging
into her veins of gold and silver and deposits of copper and lead. We
search for gems and certain very small stones by sinking shafts into
the depths. We drag out Earth’s entrails; we seek a jewel to wear on a
finger. How many hands are worn by toil so that one knuckle may shine!
If there were any beings in the nether world, assuredly the tunnelling
brought about by greed and luxury would have dug them up.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="pliny-on-deadliest-catch">Pliny on <em>Deadliest Catch</em></h2>
<p>Pliny would probably not approve of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadliest_Catch">Deadliest
Catch</a><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#14">14</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But why do I mention these trivial matters when shellfish are the
prime cause of the decline of morals and the adoption of an
extravagant life-style? Indeed, of the whole realm of Nature the sea
is in many ways the most harmful to the stomach, with its great
variety of dishes and tasty fish. But the foregoing pale into
insignificance beside the purple-fish, purple robes and pearls. As if
it were not enough for the produce of the seas to be stuffed down our
throats, it is also worn on the hands, in the ears, on the head and
all over the body of women and men alike! What has the sea to do with
clothing, the waters and waves to do with wool? The sea receives us in
a proper way only when we are without clothes. There may well be a
strong alliance between the sea and our stomach, but what connection
is there with our backs? Are we not satisfied by feeding on dangerous
things without also being clothed by them? Do we get most bodily
pleasure from luxuries that cost human life?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly enough, this dye may have lead to the death of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_of_Mauretania">Ptolemy of Mauretania</a>, the grandson of Cleopatra and Marc Antony. Supposedly, Ptolemy visited his cousin Emperor Caligula in Rome wearing a purple robe that was very well received; so much so that Caligula had him sentenced to death soon after out of jealousy.</p>
<h2 id="pliny-on-environmental-conservation">Pliny on Environmental Conservation</h2>
<p>Pliny is happy that there are at least regulations protecting the
environment of Italy<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#15">15</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such is Italy, sacred to the gods, these are its races and the towns
of its peoples. She yields place to no country in the abundance of her
mineral-bearing ores; but their exploitation is forbidden by an old
decree of the Senate relating to the conservation of Italy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, &quot;all Spain is rich in lead, iron, copper, silver and gold
mines&quot;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#16">16</a></sup>, so they don't have to go without. It is wonderful to reap
the rewards of resource extraction without paying the costs. Rome had
Spain, now there is the developing world.</p>
<h1 id="pliny-on-bad-sex">Pliny on Bad Sex</h1>
<p>His position is unsurprising<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#17">17</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man is the only animal whose first experience of mating is accompanied
by regret; this is indeed an augury for life derived from a
regrettable origin. All other animals have fixed seasons during the
year for mating, but man, as has been stated, has intercourse at any
hour of the day or night. All other animals derive satisfaction from
having mated; man gets almost none.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="pliny-on-money-in-politics">Pliny on Money in Politics</h1>
<p>Pliny thinks greed might have negative effects on the integrity of civil
society<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#18">18</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The expansion of the world and the growing extent of our resources
proved harmful to subsequent generations. Senators and judges began to
be chosen by wealth, and wealth was the only embellishment of
magistrates and commanders; lack of children began to exert the
highest influence and power, and legacy-hunting was the most
profitable occupation. ... Obsequiousness began to be the sole means
of advancement. Different men worshipped greed in different ways and
different contexts, although every man's prayer had the same goal –
namely, the acquisition of material possessions. Everywhere even
distinguished people preferred to cultivate others’ vices rather than
their own good qualities. The result is, I declare, that pleasure has
begun to live, while life itself has come to an end.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="pliny-on-medicine-and-healthy-living">Pliny on Medicine and Healthy Living</h1>
<h2 id="pliny-on-medical-expenses">Pliny on Medical Expenses</h2>
<p>He is concerned about the presence of a profit motive in life or death
situations, but seems to appreciate the role of market competition in
reducing prices<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#19">19</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Previous generations rejected not medicine but rather the medical
profession, mainly because they refused to ransom their lives with
doctors’ fees. ... Let us not indict the greed of doctors, their
financial rapacity in dealing with patients whose life is in the
balance, the fees charged for curing ailments, the payments on account
that lead to death, and the secret instructions to ease aside a
cataract rather than remove it completely. In the final analysis, the
large number of sharks using medical practice to prey on people seems
to be the best thing about the situation, in that competition between
rivals – rather than any sense of decency – reduces fees.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="pliny-on-the-medical-establishment">Pliny on the Medical Establishment</h2>
<p>He also expresses concerns about how people are willing to put their
health in the hands of authorities who use specialized jargon<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#20">20</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed no authority has any weight unless he researches and publishes
on medical matters in Greek – even in the eyes of laymen and those
with no knowledge of Greek. Where their health is concerned, people
have less faith if they understand what is written. So, here indeed is
a phenomenon unique among the sciences; anyone claiming to be a doctor
is immediately trusted, although in no other profession is an untruth
more dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pliny makes a point of how dangerous this is without strict malpractice
law<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#21">21</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But this we choose to ignore, so enticing is the pleasure each one of
us derives from wishful thinking. Moreover, culpable ignorance is not
punishable by law; there is no precedent for retribution. Doctors
learn by exposing us to risks, and conduct experiments at the expense
of our lives. Only a doctor can kill a man with impunity. Indeed the
blame is transferred to the deceased, who is criticized for want of
moderation, and it is thus the dead who are censured.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's annoyed by doctors accidentally prescribing the wrong drug,
unknowingly poisoning their patients<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#22">22</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No human intellect could have been so subtle! It is sheer medical
exhibitionism and an outrageous boast on the part of science – not
even the doctors themselves know these things. I have learned that
through ignorance of names, red lead is commonly added to medicines
instead of Indian cinnabar. This is a poison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his opinion, evidence-based medicine has given way to empty academic
speculation<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#23">23</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The remedies that I record were used by people of old – when, in a
way, Nature herself made medicine – and they endured a long time.
Gradually, however, experience, the most effective teacher of all
things – especially in the field of medicine – gave way to words and
hot air. For people find it more agreeable to sit listening in lecture
theatres than to go out into lonely places searching for different
plants at the appropriate season.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="pliny-on-cleanses-fasting-and-brazillians">Pliny on Cleanses, Fasting, and Brazillians</h2>
<p>Pliny is (<em>surprisingly</em>) concerned about the physical and moral effects
of misguided obsession with health. (He also thinks Brazillian waxes are
morally corrupting)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#24">24</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These matters concern the health of individuals; but it was what Cato
feared and foresaw – though much less deleterious and of less account,
as the leading lights of medicine themselves admit – that destroyed
the moral fibre of society. I refer to treatments we undergo when in
good health, namely, ... the potions taken during fasts, followed by
vomitings and yet larger potions; the effeminate removal of hair
through the use of resins, and, likewise, women’s pudenda exposed for
all to see thanks to depilatories.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="pliny-on-alternative-medicine">Pliny on Alternative Medicine</h2>
<p>Pliny has a strong interest in crystals from a mineralogical
perspective, but has no patience for crystal-healers<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#25">25</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall, incidentally, refute the unspeakable lies of the
magic-doctors, who have made several assertions about gems, from the
seductive pretence of their efficacy as alternative medicine to their
supernatural qualities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's frustrated by the way that legitimate herbal medicine has been
undermined by charlatans<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#26">26</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Above all, untrustworthy magic practices helped Asclepiades. These
were current to such an extent that they were able to destroy
confidence in all herbs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="pliny-on-lifestyle-changes">Pliny on Lifestyle Changes</h2>
<p>Pliny's believes a lot can be accomplished through a combination of
exercise and going outside<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#27">27</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would not be proper for me to omit remedies that depend on man’s
will-power. Fasting from all food and drink, sometimes abstaining from
baths, when health demands one of these courses of action, are all
considered among the most efficacious remedies. Among other remedies
are physical exertion, voice exercises, anointing and massage, if done
skilfully: for violent massage hardens the body, while gentle massage
softens it; and too much massage reduces the body, while a moderate
amount builds it up. Of special benefit are walking, carriage-rides of
various kinds, and horse-riding, which is good for the stomach and
hips. ... Sunshine is the best of the self-administered remedies</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="pliny-on-suicide">Pliny on Suicide</h1>
<p>Pliny lives in an upsetting world, but he takes solace in the fact that
people have a convenient way out. He could have been a very successful
SoundCloud rapper<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#28">28</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed Earth may be credited with having invented even poisons out of
pity for us, lest, when we are tired of life, starvation, a death most
out of keeping with earth’s benefits, should destroy us by a slow
wasting-away; lest precipices should scatter our lacerated body; lest
the perverted punishment of the noose that imprisons the breath of
life it seeks to extinguish should torture us; lest, if we seek death
in the depths, our burial should serve as fodder; lest the torture of
iron should rend our body. Thus Earth, out of pity for us, has
produced a substance–a very easy draught–by drinking which, like
thirsty men, we may effortlessly deprive ourselves of life without
physical injury or loss of blood, in such a way that no birds or
beasts should touch us when dead and that those who have killed
themselves should be preserved for the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="pliny-s-pale-blue-dot">Pliny's &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot;</h1>
<p>Pondering the implications of astronomy can often lead one to recognize
the futility of human wars and conflict<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#29">29</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let all these portions be taken away from the earth, or rather this
dot in the universe, as the majority of savants have taught–for this
is all the earth is in the context of the whole universe–and this then
is the substance of our glory, this is its home, here we fill
positions of power and here we covet wealth and put mankind into a
turmoil repeatedly and fight wars–even civil wars–and empty the land
by killing one another. To sum up the outward madness of nations, this
is the land in which we drive out our neighbours and dig up and steal
their turf to add to our own, so that he who has marked his acres most
widely and driven off his neighbours may rejoice in possessing an
infinitesimal part of the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare this to Sagan's &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#30">30</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the
endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this
pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other
corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to
kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of
blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and
triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a
dot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems some perspectives are timeless.</p>
